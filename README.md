# Breast-Cancer-ML-Project

This project analyzes the performance(accuracy) of most commonly used machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression , Support vector machines , 
K nearest neighbors and Decision Tree for Breast cancer analysis . Cross validation , Feature selection and Classifier Ensemble techniques
have also been used to improve the performance of these algorithms .
